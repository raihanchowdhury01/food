            <h5>Introduction:</h5>
            <p>Maintaining good health requires a well-balanced diet. A balanced diet strengthens our body, boosts immunity, and improves mental health. Here is a healthy diet control plan that will guide you on the right path.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>1. Create a Meal Plan:</h5>
            <p>Develop a balanced meal plan that includes a variety of nutritious foods. Your diet should include vegetables, fruits, proteins, balanced carbohydrates, and healthy fats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>2. Importance of Breakfast:</h5>
            <p>Start your day with a nutritious breakfast. Opt for meals like oats, cauliflower, a cup of yogurt, or a soup made with onions and tomatoes. This will keep you energized all day and reduce the likelihood of overeating.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>3. Lunch and Dinner:</h5>
            <p>Eat balanced meals for lunch and dinner. Your plate should consist of one-third vegetables, one-third protein (meat, fish, or lentils), and one-third whole grains (rice, bread). Avoid spicy foods and excessive oil and salt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>4. Snacks and Beverages:</h5>
            <p>Choose healthy snacks. You can have nuts, vegetable sticks, or fruits. Opt for healthy alternatives instead of chips or cakes. Drink plenty of water and healthy beverages like lemon water or low-sugar tea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>5. Reduce Sugar and Processed Foods:</h5>
            <p>Cut down on sugar and processed foods. Steer clear of sweet treats such as cakes, pastries, and soft drinks. Instead, consume natural sugars found in fruits, which are beneficial for your body.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-3">
            <h5>6. Meal Timing:</h5>
            <p>It's important to follow a meal schedule. Structure your day around three primary meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—along with two snack breaks. Maintain a 3-4 hour interval between meals and avoid consuming too much food at one time.</p>
